		 <h5>THE MARKETING PROBLEM WE SOLVED</h5>
		 <p>The primary objective was to carve a distinct market niche for Éterne Clinic, effectively resonating with the digitally-savvy and lifestyle-oriented consumer base. Key challenges encompassed devising and executing an innovative content strategy that would set the brand apart, amplifying local visibility to establish a strong community presence, and igniting significant pre-launch excitement. Furthermore, the task involved meticulously planning and executing a cost-effective yet impactful launch event that would not only capture widespread attention but also set the momentum for sustained success and growth in the competitive cosmetic dermatology market.</p>

			<h5>THE <span class="cp-name-contact fnt-22"> 5W&amp;N</span> SOLUTION</h5>
			<p>Our strategic approach began with comprehensive market and competitive analysis. With a deep understanding of the brand ethos, we carefully curated a brand identity that mirrored their beliefs & values and aligned with their world-class chic aesthetic. This entailed the meticulous design of the brand's logo, colour palette, and overall visual communication, encapsulating sophistication and elegance synonymous with the luxurious experiences provided by the clinic.</p>
      <p>To stand out in a crowded market we needed a revolutionary content strategy. We created unique, high-quality content that resonated with the brand's values and ethos, shared across various digital platforms. This content was not merely informative but engaging, enabling Éterne to break through the clutter, captivate the audience's attention, and generate significant pre-launch buzz. Despite content limitations and time constraints, we decided to go off the beaten track and eschew conventional before/after narratives typical of cosmetology clinics, opting instead for lifestyle-oriented content that illustrated how the clinic's services could enhance and enrich life quality. Our in-house team produced a cinematic brand film at a fraction of the usual cost. </p>
      <p>To maximise local impact, we employed a geo-targeted and hyperlocal strategy, leveraging the power of local women of influence who aligned with the brand's ethos and had a strong connection with their followers. These authentic collaborations extended our reach to a more targeted audience and bolstered the brand's credibility. Local SEO optimisation and local listings were key in enhancing brand visibility.</p>

		<div class="col-lg-12">
			<p>We embraced WhatsApp for wider audience engagement, launching an interactive campaign to spread the word about exclusive launch offers and updates about the clinic, fostering a personal connection with the brand. </p>
      <p>We initiated a pre-launch buzz with strategic release of teasers of the new chic visual identity and hints of the grand event, culminating in the brand film unveiling. Amplified through social media, influencer sneak-peeks, and WhatsApp chains, we stirred market anticipation and excitement. Our sales-oriented raffles, offering assured and attractive prizes, further spurred engagement and bookings. </p>
      <p>The grand launch was transformed into a viral event, featuring interactive live sessions with celebrities, a virtual tour of the clinic, and real-time social media activities, quickly becoming a trending topic. Our strategy was particularly focused on capitalising on the business ecosystem surrounding the clinic's location, with a limited budget driving the client’s need to generate immediate sales and pre-booking of packages to lock-in returning customers.</p>            
      <p>In conclusion, Éterne Clinic's reimagined strategy – encompassing a chic, sophisticated visual identity, innovative and localised content marketing, strategic influencer collaborations, direct engagement via WhatsApp, and a meticulously orchestrated pre-launch buzz leading to a viral launch event – was crafted to captivate the target audience, distinguish the brand in a competitive landscape, and pave the way for enduring success.</p>

			<p>To make our marketing efforts more sniper-precise, we utilised social media marketing (SMM) programmatic marketing and major A/B testing. These were tailored to individual preferences and behaviours, making them more effective in engaging potential clients. These provided valuable data and insights into customer preferences, which will inform future marketing strategies. </p>
            <p>The culmination of our efforts was a viral marketing campaign. Every post, every shout-out was engineered to be shareable, sparking conversations and creating a buzz across the digital landscape & beyond the immediate customer base of both brands</p>
            <p>We observed a significant uptick in sales by 110% and client engagement during and after the campaign. It brought in new customers and strengthened loyalty among existing ones. </p>      
            <p><img src="images/lgfg3.webp" alt="5W&N" class="d-flex wid-95 mx-auto"></p>
            <p>By blending innovative marketing techniques with an innate understanding of what makes the target audience for the brands tick, we were able to strategise & execute a campaign that didn’t just meet the goal; but knocked them out of the park. </p>
